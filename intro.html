	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>This demonstration site is an audio mixing application with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a>.
	This application operates some basic functions for audio mixing as shown below.
	<ul>
	<li>panning(pan)</li>
	<li>volume</li>
	<li>EQ</li>
	<li>compressor</li>
	<li>automation</li>
	</ul>
	Also, the layout of this application is based on general Digital Audio Workstation to use above functions. 
	The layout is as shown below.
	<ul>
	<li><a href="#transpose">Transpose</a></li>
	<li><a href="#inspector">Inspector</a></li>
	<li><a href="#track">Track</a></li>
	<li><a href="#mixer">Mixer</a></li>
	<li><a href="#effect">Effect</a></li>
	</ul>
	This page describes each layout. 
	</p>


	<h2 id="transpose">Transpose</h2>
	<p>The following figure shows "Transpose." 
	According to the figure, Transpose has three parts: "Play Time", "Repeat Time", and "Window Select."
	</p>
	<img src="fig/intro/transpose.png" width="767" height="57" alt="Transpose">

	<h3>Play Time</h3>
	<p>
	A time(e.g. "<font color="orange">00:07:703</font>" from the above figrue) next a right-pointing triangle means "<font color="orange">play time</font>."
	The time is changed automatically in playing audio. Also, this application can change the time with drag & drop operation for vertical at any time.
	</p>
	<p>
	The buttons under "play time" control the time and to play/stop audio.
	Each button from left to right is as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>Set play time to zero(00:00:000).</li>
	<li>Play audio.</li>
	<li>Stop audio.</li>
	<li>Enable/disable to set play time at start position after stop audio.</li>
	<li>Enable/disable repeat.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Repeat Time</h3>
	<p>A time(e.g. "<font color="orange">00:00:000</font>" from the above figure) next a upper left triangle means "<font color="orange">repeat start time</font>" 
	and a time(e.g. "<font color="orange">00:10:000</font>" from above the figure) next a upper right triangle menas "<font color="orange">repeat end time</font>." 
	This application can change each time with drag & drop operation for vertical at any time.
	</p>
	<p>The buttons: "Intro", "A", "B", "C", and "Outro" set repeat start/end time quickly. 
	The name of each button means a part of the demo song used this application.
	</p>

	<h3>Window Select</h3>
